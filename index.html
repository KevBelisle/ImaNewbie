<p>Welcome to this very special edition of ImaNewbie does Britannia, commemorating a web site I created over eighteen<br> years ago during the very early days of Ultima Online.  It contains all of the toons plus additional goodies like character<br> bios of all the major characters, a selection of toons from my, earlier Diablo Cartoon Pages and more! ...Enjoy!
