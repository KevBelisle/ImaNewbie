She will stand demurely in the corner of the room with a look of expectant anticipation on her face.  ***IMPORTANT***  Under NO Circumstances must you CONSUMATE the marriage.  (This is a PG Rated story and that's the nicest way I couldn't think of to say it!).  Instead,  Take the MAP OF THE STARS, drop it at her feet and say:  "Gillian.
