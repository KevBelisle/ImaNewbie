<h3>Episode 83: "Something Wicked This Way Comes! (Part 2).  Last week ImaNewbie embarked on his reign of terror ruthlessly killing a poor newbie and five people at a picnic.  This week it seems he has become even more diabolical resorting to 'dirty tricks'.  As this episode opens we find ImaNewbie hiding behind a tree about to ensnare another victim.  Make sure you have seen episodes #81 and #82 first.</h3>

<p><b>Hmmmn, the old trapped chest trick, how many of us have<br>been caught with that one.  But wait, I hear the plaintive<br>cry of a damsel in distress.  Surely even the new 'evil'<br>ImaNewbie will not be able to resist coming to the rescue.</B><p>

<p><B>Looks like I was wrong again, but then ... that night as<br>ImaNewbie is asleep in his bed, suddenly he awakes to find<br>his room bathed in a strange eerie light and the bed<br>surrounded with the spectres of those poor souls he so<br>recently dispatched to the hereafter.</B></p>

<h3>Ahah! Can this be a sign that somewhere deep in ImaNewbie's being the old pure-of-heart Ima still exists?  Or will he dismiss this vision as just an 'undigested bit of beef' or perhaps, 'a pint too many ales' that has brought on these nightmares?  There is still more of this tale to be told. Tune in next week for Part 3 of "Something Wicked This Way Comes!"</h3>
