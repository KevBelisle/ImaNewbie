<h3>Episode 72: The Conspiracy (The Trial) - After destroying the diabolical crystal machine and saving Lord British, you can imagine ImaNewbie's shock when, instead of being rewarded, he is arrested for Treason!  As this episode opens we find ImaNewbie about to have his day in court. Enjoy, but a warning, in order to show the courtroom and all the participants, these images are larger than usual.  So kick back; chill;  and wait till that little busy icon on your browser has stopped grinding. :) </h3>

<h4>This doth not bode well!  ImaNewbie has not only been accused of treason, but also Cruelty to Animals and what can only be described as an 'Overactive Libido'.  Can ImaNewbie possibly receive a fair verdict from a jury whose foreman is named "GonaKilUrAssNLootU"? ... Is there no justice in Britannia? ... Is O.J. Simpson's being attacked on the golf course the first time in history that every single person in the United States is a suspect?  Toon in next week as the Conspiracy continues with "The Verdict".</h4>
