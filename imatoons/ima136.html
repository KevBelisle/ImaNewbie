<p><font size="3"><b>Episode 136: The More Things Change - Well, 'tis truly a monumental moment in time!  I have just read how Origin has made changes that will get rid of those ridiculous "Vendor buy the guards a bank and then recsu recdu me to my destination before I ban thee" strings that clutter up your screen every time you visit a vendor or the bank.  Anyone who hasn't seen my feelings on the subject should have a look at the Britannia Enquirer, Vol. 1, No. 14. (You can get there from the main site menu).  Anyway, I felt that seeing as I tend to bash OSI from time to time about things, as far as this issue is concerned they appear to have listened, and I thought that kinda deserved a special 'toon.  Now I am not claiming that I was the reason for the change, but if my rant played even a small part, then I am content.</p>

<p>As this episode opens, ImaNewbie has just arrived<br>at the Bank of Britain to the usual seven layer<br>deep wall of spam as people try to jam fourteen<br>different commands into one speech macro.</p>
