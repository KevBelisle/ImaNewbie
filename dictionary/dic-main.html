<p>Being new to Ultima Online, ICQ or any other online communications can be a confusing experience.  The slang, abbreviations, and chatter has developed into a whole new language.  What I have tried to do here is take a lot of the common (and not so common) ways of saying things that you might encounter in-game, on icq, on IRC chat, email and other internet communcations and compile it into an alphabetical reference.  This list is by no means complete as new jargon is added all the time, but at least it should serve to get your head into the mindset needed to hold your head up and not constantly be typing "What does 'lol' mean?".</p>
