<h3>Hello My Friends</h3>

<h3>Ask yourself these questions:</H3>
</font>
   <ul>
   <LI>Are you running out of inventory slots to place all that gold you need to purchase new weapons from Griswold?
   <LI>The netherworlds below Tristram can be a dangerous place.  Do you worry about carrying all that gold around with you...what with the recent rise of muggings from some of the less savory adventurers that inhabit these regions?
   <LI>Have you ever left gold in town just to return and find it stolen by some unscrupulous thief?
   <LI>Your character isn't looking any younger!  Are you putting away a little for a rainy day?  Remember it will be several hundred years before the government of Tristram comes up with Old Age Security Benefits!
   <LI>Does Wirt offer you a Legit Goldly Plate of Whatever and and all you can do is think to yourself, "If only I had an extra 50,000 gold!"
</ul>
